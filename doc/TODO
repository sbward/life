- Request X generations per second
- Receive stream of generations via WebSocket

Extra credit:

- Send data as a compacted stream of deltas
- Verify state with regular checksums
- Resend whole state if checksum fails

Program Architecture:

- Concurrent processes:
	- 1 per simulation
	- 1 per client (WebSocket Conn)
	- New client/sim pair generator (WebSocket server)
	- HTTP server

1:N Simulation:Clients
